## How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.9+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)

Install the package with development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```


## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```bash
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```bash
nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```bash
nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.


## How to submit changes

Open a pull request to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite should pass without errors and warnings.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before commiting your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```bash
nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
